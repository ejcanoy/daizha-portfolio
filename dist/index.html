          <h2>About Daizha</h2>
          <p>
          It’s nice to meet you! My name is Daizha and I graduated from the University of Washington Bothell 
          in June of 2022 as a first generation student. I received my BA in Media and Communications with a 
          minor in Diversity. I am currently employed as Yelp Seattle’s Community Intern as well as a barista at 
          Starbucks. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Other than that, I was born and raised in Seattle, WA. I enjoy trying new foodie spots around my city,
            spending time with my loved ones and going on adventures with my dog. I would love to tell you more about
            me and my work!

              <h2>Seattle Community Intern</h2>
              <p>
                In January of 2023, I started my role with Yelp as their Seattle Community Intern. This experience has 
                allowed me to shadow Seattle’s Community Manager to learn more about marketing, event planning and social 
                media management. Each week, I am consistently writing blogs, in Yelps formatting, familiarizing myself with 
                new local businesses in Seattle, as well as creating social media content.
